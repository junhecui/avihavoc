# AviHavoc (ChaosHacks24)

# Inspiration
News of plane emissions has been everywhere recently, with countless celebrities flying their private jets out of the Super Bowl, producing more emissions in one day than the average person produces in years.

# Function
The original aim of this project was to collect live data from FlightRadar using our given API, and then display it on a globe, showcasing airplane routes and calculating their emissions.

# Technologies used
The frontend was built on React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it involves the creation of the web application and using the globe as a component to display live flights.

The backend was built on a Flask server, with a Firebase Cloud Database that would send live updates to the frontend.

# Challenges
We were rate limited by the API, and were not able to provide live updates to the data, hindering the server connection process.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The Web Application looks great and the Python works!

# What we learned
New, more complicated React Skills, utilizing Flask and Firebase, different react components and Figma design. And of course, beautiful teamwork.

# What's next for AviHavoc
Live updates are definitely on the radar!#
